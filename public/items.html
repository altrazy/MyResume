        <h2>My goal</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="main"> I want to help the team become more successful and efficient which will help the overall branch become
                 more successful and efficient.</li>
            <li class="main">I'd like get it to where everyone is on a similar skill level in their respective tech position so that
                 when someone asks for a tech they don’t have to worry about whether or not they'll be able to achieve 
                 what is asked of them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>More Regular Self Evaluations/ One on one meetings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="main">Self-evaluations shouldn't be limited to just once a year.</li>
            <li class="main"> People are more prone to follow through with a plan/idea if they 
                come up with it on their own. (learned from being a crisis counselor volunteer.)
                <ul>
                    <li class="sub">Have them assess their performance on the job they are on or a past job.</li>
                    <li class="sub">During the self-evaluations have them create a idea on how to improve areas they identified</li>
                    <li class="sub">We will then talk together on how to create a SMART Goal to achieve their plan.<br>
                        Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound</li>
                    <li class="sub">Follow up monthly to see how they are coming along and encourage them to reach out if they need help</li>
                    <li class="sub">This will help them achieve their yearly evaluations and goals.</li>
                    <li class="sub"> Overall them evaluating themselves would not only help their growth but the branch aswell.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="main">Giving them quarterly (or more often) tests to assess their knowledge and progress.
                <ul>
                    <li class="sub">These could cover various areas like CCT, SCT, Wiring details, Checkout procedure, worksites like 
                        selection navigator so they know how to get drawings and upload documents.</li>
                    <li class="sub">these tests would provide a understanding of their knowledge in each subject, allowing us to identify
                         areas for improvement and provide targeted support</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Items I'd like to address:</h2>

                                    <li>Have them all complete checkout the same way with the same tool.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure they understand what is expected of them when on site</li>
                        </ul>

                </ul>
                <br>
            <li class="main">When a LSS directs them or asks for someone</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>They need to provide the tech with the MC or subs number to call and ensure the site is ready for them
                         to do the task needed
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many techs have said they've shown up and what they were meant to do isn't ready for them. This is wasted time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If they want to reach out to the tech to let them know where they need to go instead of the STL they need to CC the STL.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If we don’t see them reach out before 3pm we will reach out in their place ccing them.</li>
                            <li>This will prevent the tech from not being informed and showing up to the wrong place.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <br>
            <li class="main">During weekly meetings ask the following: </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is going well in our team?</li>
                    <li>Where can we improve?</li>
                    <li>How can I help?
                        <ul>
                            <li>My role is to help this team grow and to ensure we're profittable. Both items go hand in hand.</li>
                            <li>I might be blind to something obvious to them</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Any meaning no matter how small drives human motivation.</li>
                            <li>Feeling meaning is like working out a muscle if you don’t do it often it will start to shrink.</li>
                            <li>People want more than just money. If we can make them feel meaning and understand the impact they have then they might not always ask for a pay raise.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Being approachable and building trust are important to leading people</li>
                    <li>If you are approachable then people are more likely to reach out or come to you when they have an issue instead of hiding it until it inevitably comes to light</li>

                            <li>This will help to create criteria for promotions to tech 2 and tech 3.</li>
