    <h2> Just some thoughts/rambles I have</h2>
    <p>
        I dont want this position for the Money if I wanted money I would've taken Miguel up on his LSS Position out in Lubbock.
        I want this position to help the techs which ultimately helps the entire branch. I'd like to get it to where when someone 
        asks for a tech they don't have to worry about who they get because I'll be honest Ive had a few techs when I heard they'd 
        be helping I thought the opposite I dont want that to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know naturally everyone learns at different paces, but Id like to at least get it to where when techs go on site who ever 
        else is onsite can be confident that the tech knows how to do what is being asked of them. (Within reason)
    </p>
    <p>
        I want it to be open communication between us I want them to Feel like they can reach out For help,
        or if they have a question they can ask it without fear of repercusion. The way I see it is if they reach out more
        then we have a better idea on what to work on with them. <br>

        Promoting an open door culture is essential. By offering one-on-one sessions and actively seeking ways to help techs grow 
        and prosper, we can build trust and encourage them to share what they might be Struggling to puck up without fear repercussion. <br> 
        
        Without trust, it's challenging to mentor and guide them effectively. To me being a manager you need to be a leader, 
        Fostering trust in your team members is crucial for everyones success.
    </p>

    <h2>Items I'd like to address if I were a leader.</h2>
    <p>
        Do we have a baseline indicating that after a year, a tech's Skill set should be at a certain level?<br>
        <i><b>Areas to get a baseline in:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>CCT</b></li>
                <li><b>SCT</b></li>
                <li><b>MUI</b></li>
                <li><b>trouble Shooting -</b> Do they have the right mindset for cirtical thinking? Can we work with
                    them to help develop this before just giving them the boot?</li>
                <li><b>Communication skills -</b> Do they understand what is expected of them? Can they get their point across in update emails to LSS/PMs</li>
            </ul></i>
        If not, I'd gladly take lead in making one with insight from every leader in our branch. So if we hire someone (or even the newer employees)
        we can inform them. For example, at the one year mark, they should be competent at modifying VAV programs in CCT. By no means do i expect them to be an expert.<br>
        This way, they know whats expected of them and can work towards achieving those tasks. <br>
        We need a structured framework so both the techs and we know what is expected from them at certain points in their career.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Do we have criteria for promotions to tech 2 and tech 3, or are promotions based solely on subjective evaluations?</b><br>
        If we can establish Clear criteria and communicate them, techs will have something to strive for. Even if there are limited spots for each position, 
        transparency is key. Leaving them in the dark can be discouraging and may lead to loss of good talent.
    </p>
    <h2>Items I'd focus on implementing at my level if I were a Leader.</h2>
    <h3><u>More regular Self evaluations/one on one meetings</u></h3>
    I believe that self-evaluations shouldn't be limited to just once a year. Both employees and the company could benefit from having individuals
    conduct self-assessments after completing a project. While it may not be necessary for every project, perhaps conducting evaluations quarterly 
    could be beneficial. This approach could help individuals recognize or evaluate their strengths and weaknesses more regularly, Ultimately leading 
    to their growth in the areas they are lacking in. Additionally, reflecting on the work they've done could help them see the value they add to Johnson Controls.
        <ul>
            <li>After they conduct a Self Evaluations and had time to really go through it we can sit down with them and talk about it going over the following.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where there things they feel they did really good at?<br>
                        Depending on how big of an ackomplisment it was Recognize them for it during a team meeting. Or at the very least give them some sort of 
                        praise during the one on one. As a leader you should be building your team up. A little praise such as "man you did an awesome job." could go a long way.
                    </li>
                    <li>Where there areas they Felt they struggled in?<br>
                        Talk with them about it and come up with a plan or solution to develop them so next time they'll be and feel more successful. We're here 
                        to build them up this isn't a time to berate them. If the people below you dont trust you they wont come to you when they are in need of help.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Where there things they had no Idea what they were doing or what was expected of them?<br>
                        This is similar to my thoughts above. We're here to assist them if we send them to a site to perform a task and they aren't prepared or 
                        how no idea how to do it that directly reflects on us. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Ultimately I think this would not just help their growth but also help our branch</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><u>Quarterly one on ones</u></h3>
    These one on ones could be longer than the monthly one on ones are and used to cover the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Tracking and discussing their areas of improvement.

            </li>
            <li>Setting SMART goals with them<br>
                talk with them about where they think they need to improve and use the SMART format to ensure it is something obtainable in a quater. Each month follow
                up during those one on ones to see how their progress is coming along. If they achieved their goal maybe get with them to set a new one.
            </li>
            <li>Review their performance on the projects they've been working on with them.

            </li>
            <li>Giving them quarterly tests to assess their knowledge and progress. These could cover various areas like CCT, SCT, Wiring details, Checkout procedure, 
                worksites like selection navigator so they know how to get drawings and upload documents.
            </li>
            <li>these tests would provide a understanding of their knowledge in each subject, allowing us to identify areas for improvement and provide targeted support
            </li>
        </ul>
